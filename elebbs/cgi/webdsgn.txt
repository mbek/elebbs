Design objectives EleWEB
------------------------

-- One generic EleWEB executable
-- Do as little as possible in the executable
-- EleXer base and only scripting langauge
-- As little as possible hardcoded into the EleWEB executable
-- script to run is specified on commandline
-- guest access should be allowed or possible
-- no hardcoded replying on temporarily directories
-- Plug & Play (auto EleBBS environment detection and sorts)
-- template support for output of HTML
-- Login can be using HTML or via HTTP/401 (HTTP-auth)
-- All data is passed using POSTS (no gets anymore) except action-number
-- Cookie support for username/password


------- Login procedure
Login should be the only time username and password is transmitted in clear
text. This should generate an unique identifier (CRC32 of password) which
in combination with username should provide login.
At login we give the weblogin a unique nodenumber. This is written in
USERON.BBS - in combination with LastUpdate (unix-timestamp) we put an expiry
time on this.


------- EleXer new fields
 web_GetUIP             - returns UIP as passed to the CGI
 web_GetUIR             - returns UIR as passed to the CGI
 web_GetUIN             - returns UIN as passed to the CGI
 web_ShowHTML           - Show HTML file with macro support
                            ^F == |F
                            ^K == |K
 web_GetDateTime        - Returns an RFC820 formatted current time
 web_GetCookie          - Get the value of a cookie
 web_SetLoginData       - Set the UIR, UIP, UIN field to the login script.
 web_GetFormData        - Get a POST or GET field

------- EleWEB.EXE (generic)
Action    = required field for all EleWEB actions.
ele_uip   = CRC32 of password (except login)
ele_uir   = Userrecord number of username (except login)
ele_uin   = Nodenumber user is logged in to. (except login)


------- EleWEB.EXE
Variables = ele_username = username to login
            ele_password = password to login
